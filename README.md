# DeepBlocker

This repository contains the Python code for performing Blocking using techniques proposed in the paper "Deep Learning for Blocking in Entity Matching: A Design Space Exploration" (VLDB 2021).

We will be providing additional details including sample Jupyter notebooks in the next few days. In the mean while, please contact Saravanan Thirumuruganathan for any questions.
